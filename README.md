**Instructions for sort_this!**

**1** Alice29.txt will be an input to your program
**2** sorted_alice.txt will be the output of your program
**3** Remove all lines not containing at least one letter character {a-z, A-Z'} from the input file
**4** Sort all lines alphabetically, with 'a' being the highest ranked character and 'z' being the lowest ranked
**5** Character case is ingored
**6** Spaces do not effect line ranking
**7** Print out system time at start and end of your programs run
**8** Try to get it to sort in less than 1s!

**Rules for sort_this!**

#1 Only personal computers can be used, no 128 core super computers
#2 Any programming language and string libraries can be used
#3 Code to actually sort the file must be your own


If think your program has what it takes contact me a nihle@mesalabs.com and we'll have a video chat so you can demo your code. Applicants who successfully demonstrate their algorthm correctly sorts the file in <1s will be put to the top of the list for the Mesa Internship Program.
